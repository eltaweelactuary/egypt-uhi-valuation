# Buy vs. Build: Actuarial Valuation Strategic Analysis

For a government authority or a major social health insurance project, deciding between building an internal tool or purchasing this specialized **UHI Valuation Model** is a critical decision.

## 1. Regulatory Specialty (Law 2/2018)
- **Internal Dev**: General programmers will struggle to map the complexities of Article 40 funding sources (Dependents, State Treasury, Tobacco taxes).
- **Our Model**: All specific Egyptian legal rates and logic are already validated and integrated.

## 2. The Inflation Complexity Gap
Social health insurance depends heavily on the **Medical vs. Wage Inflation gap**. Our engine uses a recursive projection loop designed for this specific purpose, avoiding the common pitfalls of overly simplistic linear projections in internal tools.

## 3. Professional Governance (Audit-Ready)
Custom-built internal systems often lack standardized documentation, making them a high risk for external auditors. Our system follows a decoupled architecture that is easy to audit and verify.

## 4. Interactive Simulation Power
An internal spreadsheet or script doesn't allow decision-makers (Ministers/CEOs) to interact with the data in real-time. Our Streamlit dashboard provides high-end visualizations that facilitate immediate policy discussions.

### 🏆 Conclusion
Purchasing this solution provides **Instant Compliance**, **Economic Foresight**, and **Audit Stability** that internal development cannot match within the necessary timeframe for the UHI rollout.
